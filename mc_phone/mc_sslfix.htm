This page is here due to the IE bug where it wants to have all it's frames in
the same 'security domain'.  If the SRC of a frame (even an Iframe) is blank,
IE views this as a page that is 'outside' of the secure domain of the other
pages and then warns the user: This page contains both nosecure and secure items.
